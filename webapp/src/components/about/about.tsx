        After graduating with a degree in
        <span className="font-medium">Accounting</span>, I decided to pursue my
        passion for programming. I enrolled in a coding bootcamp and learned
        <span className="font-medium">full-stack web development</span>.
        <span className="italic">My favorite part of programming</span> is the
        problem-solving aspect. I <span className="underline">love</span> the
        feeling of finally figuring out a solution to a problem. My core stack
        is
        <span className="font-medium">
          React, Next.js, Node.js, and MongoDB
        </span>
        . I am also familiar with TypeScript and Prisma. I am always looking to
        learn new technologies. I am currently looking for a
        <span className="font-medium">full-time position</span> as a software
        developer.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span className="italic">When I am not coding</span>, I enjoy playing
        video games, watching movies, and playing with my dog. I also enjoy
        <span className="font-medium">learning new things</span>. I am currently
        learning about
        <span className="font-medium">history and philosophy</span>. I'm also
        learning how to play the guitar.
